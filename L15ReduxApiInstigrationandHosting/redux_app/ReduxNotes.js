// Introduction
// Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing the state of an
// application.
// It is commonly used with React, but it can be used with any JavaScript
// framework or library. Redux provides a predictable state container,
// making it easier to manage the state of our application in a consistent
// and organized way.



// Why use Redux ?
// We use redux because it helps us in avoiding prop drilling and it makes accessing and manipulation of
// state very easy.
// The main advantage is we can access state from anywhere in our application and we can change state
// from anywhere in our application.







// Terminology
// Store:
// In Redux, a store is a JavaScript object that holds the state of our application. It is
// the central piece of the Redux architecture, allowing us to manage and access the
// application state in a predictable way.




// Reducer:
// A reducer is a pure function in Redux that takes the current state and an
// action as arguments, and returns a new state based on that action.
// Reducers are responsible for specifying how the application's state changes
// in response to actions.




// Terminology
// Slice:
// In Redux Toolkit, a slice is a function that generates a reducer along with
// corresponding action creators. It encapsulates the logic for a specific piece
// of the Redux state. Slices make it easier to manage and organize your Redux
// code by grouping related logic together.
